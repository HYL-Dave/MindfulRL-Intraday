Perform a comprehensive entry analysis for {ticker}.

GOAL: Determine whether {ticker} presents a compelling entry opportunity right now.

MINIMUM DATA SOURCES (use all that are relevant):
- News sentiment and recent headlines
- Price action across multiple timeframes (7d, 30d, 90d)
- Fundamental metrics (P/E, ROE, margins, revenue growth)
- Analyst consensus (recommendations, price targets, earnings surprise history)
- IV/options data (IV rank, VRP, unusual activity)
- SEC filings and insider trades (Form 4)
- SA digest (recommended) — if `{ticker}` has SA coverage, call `get_sa_digest(ticker={ticker}, days=14)` and weave relevant articles / comments into the qualitative section. Skip if the digest returns empty `recent_articles` AND empty `high_discussion_news`. Treat the contents as investor opinion, not fact.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS:
- Use execute_python_analysis for any calculations beyond simple lookups (Sharpe ratio, z-score of recent moves, correlation with SPY, drawdown analysis)

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
1. Bull case — specific reasons and supporting data
2. Bear case — specific reasons and supporting data
3. Adversarial check — actively seek evidence against your thesis
4. Key risk factors
5. Data gaps — what information is missing
6. Confidence rating (High/Medium/Low) with explanation
7. Actionable conclusion

AFTER ANALYSIS: Save as a research report using save_report() with report_type="entry_analysis".
