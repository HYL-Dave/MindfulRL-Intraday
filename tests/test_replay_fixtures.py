"""P0.1 full-v1 commit 3: parametrised pytest replay gate.

This module IS the spec's main contribution — it re-validates every
fixture under ``tests/replay_fixtures/`` against the live
``ToolRegistry`` whenever pytest runs. A PR that renames a tool,
deletes a registry entry used by a fixture, drops
``delegate_to_subagent`` from the bridge surface, or changes a pinned
tool contract fails this gate with a message naming the offending
fixture and drift.

There is no automatic CI / pre-commit infrastructure today (per spec
§2.3). When future CI lands, wiring this module is a one-line
addition. Until then, the gate is a developer-discipline regression
vector — same status as every other test in the repo.
