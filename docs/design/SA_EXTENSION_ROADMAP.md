# Seeking Alpha Extension Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-07-25

## Goal

Extend the current Seeking Alpha extension beyond Alpha Picks article/comments so it can collect a broader but still practical set of SA signals.

Primary design principle:

- prioritize **recent, high-value, low-latency** data first
- avoid large historical backfills unless they clearly support a specific training use case
- let datasets accumulate over time through regular sync

This roadmap assumes the existing Alpha Picks pipeline remains the foundation and new sources are added incrementally.

## Current baseline

Already implemented today:

- Alpha Picks portfolio sync
- Alpha Picks articles metadata
- Alpha Picks article body capture
- Alpha Picks comments capture
- bounded quick/full/deep-backfill refresh modes

Current content-capture limitations for Alpha Picks article bodies are documented in `docs/design/SA_ALPHA_PICKS_CONTENT_CAPTURE.md`.

Reliability baseline LIVE as of 2026-07-25:

- Firefox packaging is dependency-closed and atomic; a missing runtime file
  fails before replacing the previous build.
- Extension outcomes are structured and aggregate status is derived from
  phase/item truth, so partial detail failure cannot hide behind success.
- Market News supports audited no-age recorded-ID retry and bounded incident
  rediscovery; the reviewed historical manifest completed with zero retryable
  items.
- The English popup groups five routine controls, states exact bounds and
  non-guarantees, exposes contextual/Advanced recovery without F12, and has
  installed Chrome/Firefox contrast verification.
- Firefox is the single auto-sync owner by operating choice; Chrome is a
  manual fallback because scrolling capture may activate the working tab.

This baseline does not adopt an embedded or app-owned collector. Lifecycle
telemetry, shared capture-core extraction, and the embedded-browser decision
remain P2.6 Part 2 work under the prerequisite below.

## P0 prerequisite: capture runtime stability and embedded-browser readiness

This roadmap now has a runtime prerequisite before adding broader SA surfaces or replacing the external browser path.

Why:

- The Firefox/extension workflow is a protected runtime surface, but long-running browser sessions can become memory-heavy and slow.
- A future embedded browser is already a deferred product direction, but it should not inherit the extension's lifecycle leaks, duplicate listeners, unbounded queues, or login/session fragility.
- Seeking Alpha capture must remain user-driven and durable while the runtime moves from "external browser extension" toward an app-owned capture backend.

Required prework:

1. **Runtime telemetry**
   - Record browser kind, extension version, capture mode, session id, active tab/url class, native-port open/close counts, message queue depth, batch sizes, scrape duration, cleanup timestamp, and failure reason.
   - When available, sample browser/renderer memory or at least process RSS around quick/full/deep refresh runs.
   - Surface this as local diagnostic state, not as remote telemetry.

2. **Lifecycle hardening**
   - Content-script injection must be idempotent per tab/frame.
   - `MutationObserver`, timers, DOM listeners, native messaging ports, and in-memory caches must be explicitly disconnected on navigation, tab close, refresh completion, and cancellation.
   - Scrapers must not keep long-lived DOM node references, whole-page HTML snapshots, or unbounded arrays once a batch is sent.
   - Native-host writes stay short, bounded, and retryable; failures must be visible but must not make the browser retain large pending payloads indefinitely.

3. **Capture-core extraction**
   - Split SA capture into a shared, testable core protocol plus thin adapters:
     - Chrome/Firefox extension adapter.
     - Future embedded-browser adapter.
     - Native/app-owned write adapter.
   - The core protocol owns normalized capture messages, batch boundaries, cancellation, dedupe keys, and evidence provenance.
   - Browser-specific code owns only page access, session/login state, and user gesture plumbing.

4. **Soak and restart acceptance**
   - Run a multi-hour soak with repeated SA navigation, quick/full refresh, tab close/reopen, browser restart, and native-host reconnect.
   - Acceptance: no duplicate content scripts/listeners, no stuck native ports, bounded queue sizes, stable or recoverable memory growth, no lost committed captures, and clear recovery instructions if a temporary extension disappears after browser restart.

5. **Embedded-browser gate**
   - Before adopting an embedded browser backend, decide the browser engine strategy, SA login-profile persistence, extension-support model, renderer recycle policy, memory budget, and compliance/ToS posture.
   - If the chosen embedded browser cannot safely run the existing extension as-is, it must use the shared capture core through a dedicated embedded adapter instead of copying extension internals.

Implementation order:

1. Add diagnostics to the existing Firefox/Chrome extension and native-host path.
2. Fix lifecycle leaks exposed by the diagnostics.
3. Extract the capture-core protocol behind the current extension.
4. Only then spike the embedded-browser adapter.

This prerequisite is intentionally before broader source expansion. New SA surfaces can still be added later, but the capture runtime must first be observable and bounded.

## Product framing

Not all SA surfaces need the same retention policy.

### Bucket A: recent feed data

Examples:

- `https://seekingalpha.com/market-news`
- `https://seekingalpha.com/latest-articles`

These are most useful when recent. Full historical backfill is optional. A rolling window plus ongoing daily collection is usually enough.

### Bucket B: daily snapshot data

Examples:

- `https://seekingalpha.com/etfs-and-funds/etf-tables/key_markets`
- right-rail structured widgets such as Factor Grades

These are more like state snapshots than event streams. They should be stored as periodic snapshots, not article text.

### Bucket C: deep article enrichment

Examples:

- article-body images
- Factor Grades attached to article pages
- symbol page widgets

These are useful but secondary compared with getting the main feeds working reliably.

## Recommended priority

### P1: Market News

Source:

- `https://seekingalpha.com/market-news`

Why first:

- high signal for recent developments
- lighter than full article-body scraping
- naturally useful for recent monitoring and later time-series accumulation
- should be fast enough for regular sync

Recommended scope v1:

- headline
- URL
- article/news ID
- published timestamp
- ticker list if visible
- short summary text if visible
- source/category labels if visible
- comment count if available

Recommended retention model:

- recent-first only
- rolling window, e.g. last 7-30 days in active refresh
- older data accumulates naturally as the system runs over time

Recommended refresh:

- quick: last few screens / latest items only
- full: deeper same-day or recent-window sync
- no deep historical crawl initially

Storage shape:

- new table, e.g. `sa_market_news`
- optional child table for news tickers if many-to-many is needed

### P2: Latest Articles (platform-wide analyst articles)

Source:

- `https://seekingalpha.com/latest-articles`

Why second:

- broad analyst coverage across the platform
- useful for idea flow and sentiment
- likely much noisier and higher-volume than Alpha Picks

Recommended scope v1:

- metadata first, not full-body first
- title
- URL
- article ID
- author
- published timestamp
- article type/category
- ticker list if visible
- comment count if visible

Recommended scope v2:

- selective detail fetch only for:
  - watchlist tickers
  - unusually high-comment articles
  - user-manual fetch

Reasoning:

- full-body capture of all latest articles will create a large noisy corpus quickly
- metadata-first keeps cost and complexity under control
- detail fetch can be demand-driven

Storage shape:

- new table, e.g. `sa_latest_articles`
- if body capture is later enabled, reuse the existing article-body/comment pipeline concepts

### P3: Key Markets snapshot

Source:

- `https://seekingalpha.com/etfs-and-funds/etf-tables/key_markets`

Why third:

- useful daily market-state snapshot
- likely low frequency requirement (daily is enough)
- may overlap with other providers, so urgency is lower than news/article feeds

Recommended scope v1:

- capture table rows exactly as visible
- persist snapshot timestamp
- preserve raw values and normalized values where feasible

Recommended refresh:

- once per day
- optionally manual refresh on demand

Storage shape:

- snapshot table, e.g. `sa_key_markets_snapshots`
- possibly one header table + one row table

Important note:

- if another provider already gives equivalent data more reliably, this source may be optional rather than core

### P4: Factor Grades

Why not first:

- useful, but not mandatory
- not every article has it
- it is a structured sidebar widget, not part of article-body capture

Recommended scope:

- scrape as separate structured data
- do not mix it into body Markdown

Potential uses:

- quick stock quality snapshot
- historical grade drift if sampled regularly
- article context enrichment

Storage shape:

- separate structured table keyed by ticker + scraped_at

### P5: Article-body image metadata

Current status:

- body images are not explicitly captured today

Recommended scope:

- `src`
- `alt`
- nearby caption text
- maybe image order within article

Why low-medium priority:

- useful in some cases
- but many images add little if the text already explains the argument
- URL-only storage has some value, but not guaranteed archival durability

## Recommended implementation order

### Phase SA-R1: Market News v1 — implemented 2026-04-07

Delivered:

- list scraper
- new DB table
- DAL methods
- one tool for querying recent news (`get_sa_market_news`)
- quick/full refresh semantics tuned for recent items only

Success criteria:

- fast incremental sync
- stable dedupe by news ID or canonical URL
- useful recent corpus for monitoring and later model training

Operational follow-ups completed after SA-R1:

- `News Catchup` mode now splits queue budget into `current` and bounded `backfill`
- `backfill` is constrained to **known news published within the last 24 hours**
- Market News auto-sync supports `Auto` cadence with ET windows derived from observed publish density

The 24-hour bound remains the routine product contract. The reliability design
at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-sa-extension-reliability-control-clarity-design.md`
does not widen routine catch-up. It adds two explicitly different recovery
mechanisms: exact recorded-ID retry with no age predicate, and an audited
incident operation over the actual gap since the latest derived-complete run,
capped at 168 hours. The latter is a bounded attempted recovery, reports known
detail repair separately from metadata rediscovery, and never claims complete
historical coverage. Arbitrary date ranges and generic lifetime backfill remain
out of scope.

The corresponding RED-first implementation plan is at
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-25-sa-extension-reliability-control-clarity.md`.
Independent implementation review is GREEN at product tip `c85f4bed` with zero
required changes: packaging closure, derived structured outcomes, durable
degraded observability, resumable repair, five honest popup controls,
copied-DB proofs, Chrome/native lifecycle, Firefox exact-artifact accessibility,
and localized web-health matrices are complete. Fast-forward merge and
merged-tree deployment verification are approved. Historical repair remains
blocked on a fresh installed-build preview and exact-manifest approval.

Supporting analysis logic now lives in:

- `src/service/sa_market_news_density.py`
  - pure analysis helpers for ET bucket aggregation, interval recommendation, and merged schedule windows
  - intended as the reusable logic layer if auto-sync tuning is later exposed via API or jobs

The removed `scripts/analysis/analyze_sa_market_news_density.py` command below
is completed historical evidence, not a current operator instruction:

```text
python scripts/analysis/analyze_sa_market_news_density.py --days 30 --bucket-minutes 60
```

Any future recalibration surface must call the retained app-owned analysis
module through its own reviewed API or job rather than restoring a root script.

### Phase SA-R2: Latest Articles metadata v1

Deliver:

- metadata-only scraper
- ticker extraction if visible
- query tool for recent analyst articles

Success criteria:

- manageable volume
- no immediate explosion in storage or scrape time
- supports filtering by ticker/keyword/date

### Phase SA-R3: Key Markets daily snapshot

Deliver:

- daily snapshot scraper
- normalized storage
- simple retrieval tool

Success criteria:

- one clean daily snapshot
- stable parsing across minor DOM changes

### Phase SA-R4: Factor Grades structured capture

Deliver:

- dedicated structured scraper
- storage keyed by ticker + scraped_at

Success criteria:

- no coupling to article body pipeline
- easy daily or per-article refresh

### Phase SA-R5: Selective article enrichment

Deliver:

- article image metadata capture
- optional HTML+Markdown dual storage only if needed later

Success criteria:

- added value without materially increasing scrape fragility

## Data model guidance

Do not force all new SA sources into `sa_articles`.

Recommended rule:

- article-like longform content -> article tables
- feed items / news -> news tables
- daily market snapshots -> snapshot tables
- sidebar grades/widgets -> structured metric tables

This keeps the semantics clear and avoids overloading one storage shape for everything.

## Refresh strategy guidance

### Quick Refresh

Use for:

- latest market news
- latest items from recent article feeds
- incremental updates only

### Full Scan

Use for:

- deeper recent-window sync
- bounded backlog cleanup
- metadata reconciliation

### Deep Backfill

Use only where historical backlog truly matters.

Not every SA surface needs deep backfill. In particular:

- market news should probably remain recent-window only
- latest-articles should start metadata-first and recent-first
- daily snapshot pages should usually not backfill deeply at all

## Risks and constraints

### DOM fragility

SA layout can change. Feed/list pages are usually easier to keep stable than complex article detail pages.

### Access control

Some resources may require active authenticated session state. Public CDN image URLs have some value, but not guaranteed long-term durability.

### Volume explosion

`latest-articles` can grow quickly. Metadata-first is the safest initial policy.

### Data overlap

Some surfaces may overlap with existing providers. Only keep SA sources where they add unique signal, timeliness, or convenience.

## Recommended near-term plan

If only one new SA surface is implemented next, it should be:

1. `market-news`

After that:

2. `latest-articles` metadata-first
3. `key_markets` daily snapshot
4. `Factor Grades` structured capture
5. article image metadata

## Decision summary

- Use a **separate roadmap document** for detailed planning.
- Keep `docs/design/AGENT_EVOLUTION_TRACKER.md` as a short summary + pointer.
- Prefer **recent-window accumulation** over large immediate backfills for general SA feeds.
- Treat Factor Grades as a separate structured source, not part of article body scraping.
- Treat image URL capture as optional enrichment, not a prerequisite for the broader SA expansion.
