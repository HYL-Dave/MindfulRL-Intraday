"""Domain-partitioned IBKR client ids.

One Gateway session accepts many API clients, but each concurrent connection
needs a unique clientId — sharing one id across the prices worker, the news
worker, option tools, and manual smokes means any overlap rejects the second
connector and pollutes cross-domain diagnostics. Deriving per-domain ids from
the single IBKR_CLIENT_ID base (app-DB authority via the S-J env bridge) keeps
Settings to one field while giving every domain its own connection identity.

This is isolation hardening, NOT a throughput lever: Gateway pacing and the
shared ibkr_gateway_lock stay exactly as they are.

# 103, and archived scan/iv scripts stomp the env with random 100–999. quotes=+50
