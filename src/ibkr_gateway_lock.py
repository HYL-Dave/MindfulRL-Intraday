"""Shared IBKR Gateway lock — one TWS/Gateway session at a time, across the whole app.

Every IBKR consumer serializes on the same mutex: the scheduler's ``run_source``
(IBKR sources), the standalone direct price backfill
(``market_data_direct.backfill_prices_direct``), and the future intraday-behavior operation. The
Gateway is single-session — two concurrent ``reqHistoricalData`` storms (e.g. a manual backfill
racing a scheduled IV pull) corrupt each other; this lock makes that impossible whether the
callers are in one process (threads) or two (sidecar + CLI).

Two layers, both required:
- ``IBKR_THREAD_LOCK`` (in-process ``threading.Lock``) — one IBKR op per sidecar process.
- ``IBKR_FILE_LOCK`` (``flock`` on ``data/locks/ibkr_gateway.lock``) — one IBKR op across
  processes (the sidecar vs the daily_update CLI), since a threading.Lock can't see across them.

``ibkr_gateway_lock()`` is the context manager for standalone callers; the scheduler uses the two
singletons directly to keep its distinct skip-reason telemetry. The two paths share the SAME
objects, so they're mutually exclusive. NOTE: these locks are NOT re-entrant — a caller already
holding the gateway lock (e.g. the scheduler running a direct-backfill adapter) must NOT acquire
it again; pass that through explicitly rather than nesting.
