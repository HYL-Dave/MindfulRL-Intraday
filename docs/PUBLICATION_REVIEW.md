# Publication Review Policy

ArkScope's design docs are being **unlocked from git-crypt and made public** (the
repo is open-source). This file is the policy for keeping them publishable. The
goal is **honest, clean public docs** — not hiding work.

> Most docs are NOT sensitive. The concern is rarely "this can't be open-sourced";
> it's "this idea isn't proven yet" or "this approach was abandoned." So the rules
> below are mostly about **labeling maturity** and **pruning dead approaches**,
> with a small **secrets/PII hygiene** floor.

---

## 1. Secrets & PII hygiene (hard floor — never publish)
- **No secrets.** No API keys, tokens, passwords, or connection strings with
  embedded credentials. Use generic environment-variable names only; real values
  live in `config/.env` (gitignored).
- **No internal infra.** Generalize internal IPs and hosts as
  `<internal-host>:<port>`. Generic public port conventions are fine.
- **No personal absolute paths.** `~/…` for runnable snippets; `<repo-root>` /
  `<workspace>` / `<data-root>` for layout references — keep the meaningful suffix
  so "where things live" still reads.
- **No personal identifiers** (OS username, personal email, real name).
- Intentional public identifiers are fine to keep: the native-messaging host id
  `com.mindfulrl.sa_alpha_picks`, addon id `sa-alpha-picks@mindfulrl.local`, and
  the local dev port `8420`.
- Paid-provider pricing must carry a `verified_at:` date (prices go stale).

## 2. Maturity labeling (the real point)
A public design doc may describe an **unproven** idea — that's fine, **as long as
it's labeled as such and not overclaimed**.
- Every design doc should carry a status (see **`docs/design/README.md`** — the
  index/status map): CANON / ACTIVE / SHIPPED / DECISION / DEFERRED / PAUSED / MERGE.
- Do **not** present a sketch or hypothesis as a shipped, validated feature. If a
  scoring/signal/strategy idea hasn't been shown to work out-of-sample, say so
  ("proposed", "unvalidated", "deferred") rather than implying it's proven.
- When the underlying code is open-sourced, the features it contains are public
  anyway — so the matching design doc being public is consistent. The honesty bar
  is *accuracy about maturity*, not concealment.

## 3. Prune abandoned approaches
- Remove HOW-docs for approaches no longer used (even if once implemented) rather
  than leaving them to read as current. Provenance worth keeping goes to
  `docs/history/` (small WHAT/WHY records) or is recoverable via git.
- Superseded process journals (audits, consolidation logs) fold into the canonical
  doc or history; they are not standalone authority.

## 4. Stays ENCRYPTED for now (per-file review before unlocking)
These are kept under git-crypt not because they're "secret" but because they hold
**personal strategy / purchasing decisions / unvalidated value judgments** the
author wants to release deliberately, per-file, when ready:
- `docs/strategy/**` — personal investing strategy / methodology.
- `data_sources/PAID_SUBSCRIPTION_EVALUATION.md` — paid-plan purchasing analysis.
- `data_sources/*_VALUE.md` — data-value judgments.

Unlocked now: **`docs/design/**` + `docs/features/**`** (after the §1 sanitization).
To unlock more later: sanitize per §1, confirm maturity-labeled per §2, then remove
the `filter=git-crypt` line from `.gitattributes` and `git add --renormalize`.

## 5. Known incidents

- A historical development credential was once tracked in plaintext and must be
  treated as permanently compromised because Git retains prior blobs. It is not
  used by any current service. Publication review must reject any reintroduction
  of that value or any credential derived from it.
