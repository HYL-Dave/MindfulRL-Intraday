# Agent Data-Gap Fallback Plan

**Status:** ACTIVE backlog  
**Created:** 2026-06-19  
**Owner area:** Agent tools + provider/data-source reliability  

## 1. Why This Exists

The agent already has many structured data tools, including SEC EDGAR, local
news, and provider-backed market-data tools. The gap found on 2026-06-19 is not
"no tool exists"; it is that a failed data primitive does not always produce a
structured reason or trigger a reliable fallback path.

Concrete trigger:

- Sidecar log showed `SEC_CONTACT_EMAIL not set`.
- SEC lookup for `SNDK` failed with `Could not find CIK for SNDK`.
- SEC-dependent tools repeated `No SEC data found for SNDK`.
- At the time, general web search was available to the agent, but no
  deterministic workflow required it to resolve the missing CIK or fill the
  evidence gap.

For a research workbench, this must be explicit. Missing data is acceptable;
silent repetition, ambiguous empty results, and unsupported speculation are not.

## 2. Current Grounding

Current code behavior:

- `get_fundamentals_analysis()` tries stored/DAL fundamentals, then falls back to
  SEC EDGAR XBRL.
- `get_sec_filings()` calls SEC EDGAR directly.
- SEC ticker-to-CIK lookup currently returns empty on a miss and logs a warning.
- `SEC_CONTACT_EMAIL` is read from env/config and missing values use a
  placeholder User-Agent, which can be rejected or rate-limited by SEC.
- Tavily search/fetch retired on 2026-08-24. No current registry tool provides
  general search; `web_browse` remains a separately gated browser-automation
  capability, not a search fallback. Provider-neutral hosted-search adapters
  remain future work and must declare support per provider/auth/harness path.

Current prompt behavior:

- The shared prompt tells the agent not to speculate when SEC filings are empty.
- It does not guarantee "SEC CIK miss -> resolve ticker identity -> retry SEC or
  web-search evidence".

## 3. Design Principle

Data primitives should return structured absence, not only empty arrays or stderr
logs. Agent orchestration can then decide whether to:

1. retry with a resolved identifier,
2. use an enabled, lower-fidelity external-evidence fallback,
3. show a visible data gap, or
4. stop and say the evidence is insufficient.

General search may be allowed for a task, but critical fallback paths must first
use structured internal/provider sources and must not depend only on the model
remembering to search.

## 4. Scope

### In Scope

- SEC User-Agent/contact hygiene.
- Structured SEC failure reasons.
- Ticker/CIK identity resolution.
- A provider-neutral hosted-search fallback policy for typed evidence gaps;
  implementation remains separately reviewed and capability-gated.
- Per-turn deduping so the same failed SEC lookup is not repeated several times.
- Agent-facing evidence-gap messages that are visible in AI Research.
- Tests that prove fallback behavior without live SEC/web calls.

### Out of Scope

- Replacing SEC EDGAR.
- Letting web search overwrite structured SEC facts.
- Adding a new paid provider solely for this issue.
- Changing the AI Research run lifecycle architecture.
- Solving all ticker corporate-action history in one slice.

## 5. Proposed Slices

### Slice DG-0 — SEC Contact Hygiene

Goal: make missing `SEC_CONTACT_EMAIL` visible and easy to fix.

Tasks:

- Surface `SEC_CONTACT_EMAIL` missing in provider health / Settings data-source
  diagnostics.
- Keep the env/config fallback for now, consistent with
  `CONFIG_AUTHORITY_PLAN.md`.
- Add a test that missing contact produces a structured warning, not only a
  stderr line.

Acceptance:

- User can see "SEC contact missing" before a research turn fails.
- SEC tools still run in dev mode, but the warning is explicit.

### Slice DG-1 — Structured SEC Absence

Goal: replace ambiguous SEC empty results with typed reasons.

Tasks:

- Return machine-readable reasons such as:
  - `sec_contact_missing`
  - `cik_not_found`
  - `sec_rejected_or_rate_limited`
  - `no_filings`
  - `no_xbrl_statements`
- Preserve the existing list/result shapes for backwards compatibility where
  needed, but add a diagnostic envelope for agent-facing paths.
- Add tests with mocked SEC responses.

Acceptance:

- AI Research can distinguish "ticker not resolved" from "SEC has no filing
  data" from "SEC rejected the request".

### Slice DG-2 — Ticker Identity Resolver

Goal: give the agent/tool layer a deterministic first stop before web search.

Tasks:

- Add or adapt a resolver using local symbol catalog + SEC company ticker map.
- Return `{ticker, cik, company_name, confidence, source, aliases}`.
- If a ticker is not found, return `not_found` with suggested next action rather
  than guessing.
- Use this resolver in SEC filing/fundamental paths.

Acceptance:

- A CIK miss produces one resolver attempt, one structured result, and no repeated
  blind SEC retries in the same turn.

### Slice DG-3 — External Evidence Fallback Policy

Goal: make general search a controlled, provider-neutral fallback rather than an
accidental model choice or a substitute for structured provider data.

Tasks:

- Add prompt/tool policy: if structured SEC, identity, and enabled provider
  sources return a typed evidence gap, use general search only when the selected
  provider/auth/harness path supports it and task policy allows it; otherwise
  explicitly report insufficient evidence.
- Prefer source-specific queries such as `"<ticker> SEC CIK 10-K"` and company
  investor-relations pages before broad news queries.
- Keep web results lower confidence than structured SEC data.

Acceptance:

- A missing SEC identity can lead to a visible general-search attempt through a
  supported adapter or a visible refusal to speculate.
- Web evidence is labeled as web-derived, not SEC-derived.

### Slice DG-4 — Data-Gap Telemetry

Goal: make data gaps queryable over time.

Tasks:

- Record provider/tool attempts with provider, operation, ticker, status,
  latency, failure reason, fallback source, and record count.
- Align with `DATA_COLLECTION_AND_LOCAL_STORAGE_PLAN.md` Slice 5 provider-health
  telemetry instead of inventing a separate telemetry model.
- Add a compact UI/trace line in AI Research for repeated data gaps.

Acceptance:

- Repeated failures like "SNDK CIK not found" are visible as one diagnostic
  event, not repeated opaque stderr lines.

## 6. Priority

Recommended priority:

1. Immediate manual fix: set `SEC_CONTACT_EMAIL`.
2. Finish the current Slice 6 live-auth verification and Slice 7 decision.
3. Implement DG-0/DG-1 as a small hardening slice.
4. Implement DG-2/DG-3 before relying on the agent for broad event-explanation
   workflows.
5. Fold DG-4 into the provider-health telemetry work.

This is important, but it should not interrupt the current auth/run-lifecycle
closing work unless SEC/web evidence gaps become the main blocker in live use.
