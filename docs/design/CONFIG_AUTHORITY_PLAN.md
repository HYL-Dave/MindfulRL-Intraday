# Config Authority Plan — DB-first settings, file fallback, retirement gates

**Status:** ACTIVE decision record. This is the cross-cutting authority for
where ArkScope configuration should live and when file/env-backed settings can
be retired. Feature-specific plans still own their implementation details; this
doc owns the source-of-truth rules.

**Related docs:**

- `CREDENTIAL_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` implements these rules for LLM credentials,
  OAuth tokens, `.env` import/export, and active key selection.
- `LLM_AUTH_DRIVER_PLAN.md` owns provider/auth-mode driver architecture.
- `DATA_COLLECTION_AND_LOCAL_STORAGE_PLAN.md` and `LOCAL_STORAGE_TOPOLOGY.md`
  own data-storage topology. This doc only decides configuration authority, not
  storage topology.

---

## 1. Decision

ArkScope should move toward **DB-first app settings**, not "no config files".

The rule:

> Any setting a normal user should change inside the app must eventually be
> stored, displayed, validated, and switched through Settings/profile DB. File
> and env config remain only for bootstrap, dev/CI, emergency fallback, and
> explicit import/export.

The product meaning of "config" is therefore:

> Config files are **transfer artifacts**. They are produced by export so a user
> can back up, inspect, move, or reinstall ArkScope, and consumed by import so DB
> / Settings can take over again. They are not the normal live authority for
> mutable app behavior after import.

This avoids the current split-brain pattern where `.env`, `user_profile.yaml`,
local DB rows, and Settings can each appear to own the same behavior.

## 2. Authority Classes

| Class | Authority | Examples | File/env role |
|---|---|---|---|
| User-facing runtime settings | DB / Settings | active LLM credential, model route, AI Research effort, data-source enablement, schedule toggles | transfer artifact + fallback until migration is complete |
| Secrets and OAuth tokens | Credential DB + token-store | API keys, Claude setup-token, future ChatGPT OAuth token | bootstrap/import only; API keys may export for portability; OAuth tokens should not be plaintext-exported by default |
| Source catalogs reviewed in PR | Files | curated macro series, fixed sector/event taxonomies, checked-in model catalog seeds | primary source, because reviewability matters |
| Local bootstrap and rescue | Files/env | profile DB path, emergency disable flags, dev ports, CI overrides | remains valid permanently |
| Generated or user data | Local DBs/files by domain | captured SA data, research threads, caches, local market DBs | not covered by this doc except where config points to them |

The important distinction: **configuration that changes product behavior for a
user should be visible and editable in the product**. Static catalogs and rescue
flags are allowed to stay file-backed.

Exported config should round-trip back into the DB where possible. Import should
not leave shadow settings that silently keep influencing runtime after the DB
setting exists; if a fallback remains, it must be labeled as fallback in UI/logs.

---

## 3. Retirement Gate

A file/env setting may be retired only after all gates pass:

1. **DB schema exists** for the setting, with migrations and idempotent upgrades.
2. **Settings UI exists** to view and edit it, including current effective value.
3. **Runtime reads DB first** and logs or displays an explicit fallback if it uses
   file/env.
4. **Import path exists** from the old file/env shape into DB.
5. **Export/backup path exists** if portability matters.
6. **Tests cover** migration, fallback, effective-value resolution, and no-secret
   response behavior where secrets are involved.
7. **User-facing state is understandable**: no hidden duplicate rows, positional
   `[0]`/`[1]` labels, or "active" flags that do not affect runtime.
8. **Rollback story is explicit** for at least one release/slice: fallback remains
   available or a backup is created before destructive cleanup.

Until these gates pass, the file/env value is not "wrong"; it is a fallback or
legacy authority that must be labeled honestly.

## 4. Current Authority Map

### LLM Credentials

**Target:** DB/token-store authoritative, `.env` fallback/import/export.

Current status:

- OpenAI API keys: DB rows are imported/named; active DB key is wired into live
  OpenAI client construction.
- Anthropic API key: DB row exists. Claude `claude_code_oauth` (subscription)
  Research is **live-validated** (Slice 7B Research-stream consumer, commits
  `5f0ea35`→`9131f7f`) — NOT env fallback. The sync `live_anthropic_client`
  accessor intentionally stays fail-closed for OAuth-active; the live path is the
  C-2 Research `stream_llm` consumer (see `SLICE_7B3_SDK_DRIVER_DESIGN.md` §8).
- Claude setup-token: token-store import/probe works; subscription Research is live.
- `.env`: no longer the intended day-to-day switch surface, but still fallback
  and portability format.

Next gate:

- AI Research model-route UI: DONE (Slice B1 backend + B2 full-stack — `ai_research`
  is in TaskId/TASKS/`/config/runtime`/`/config/model-catalog`, Settings → Models
  renders+saves it, and the Research header + send-area chip show the resolved
  route). Slice 6 cheap live test: ✅ DONE 2026-06-19 (live `run_query_stream`
  calls — DB-only OpenAI key resolved + answered on HTTP transport; OpenAI
  switch affected the live run; Anthropic Claude-OAuth → explicit env fallback
  note). Live credential routing confirmed.
- DONE (Slice 7B): `claude_code_oauth` runs Research through the subscription path
  (live-validated), not env fallback. OpenAI `chatgpt_oauth` login/token/probe/
  discovery are built; S3 Research execution is now code-wired through the raw
  ChatGPT-backend driver (offline-verified, live smoke pending). Direct OpenAI
  SDK-client paths (`live_openai_client` / Agents-SDK global client) still fail
  closed for `chatgpt_oauth` because they cannot consume that subscription token.

### Model Routing

**Target:** Settings/DB authoritative for task routes; built-in defaults are only
seeds.

Current status:

- **DB-authoritative (shipped 2026-06-22).** The per-task routes
  (`{ai_research,card_synthesis,card_translation}_{provider,model,effort}`) now resolve
  **real env > profile DB (`model_route` table) > `user_profile(.local).yaml` > built-in
  default**; a DB route is taken atomically (no field-merge). `user_profile.local.yaml`
  is demoted to fallback + import/export, mirroring the env-bridge precedence in
  `data_provider_config.py`.
- Settings → Models surfaces the full authority loop: a source badge per route
  (DB / yaml-fallback / env-override / default), **reset-to-fallback**
  (`DELETE /config/model-routes/{task}` removes the DB row), and yaml↔DB
  import/export (export mirrors DB state — present tasks write keys, absent tasks
  clear them — into `local.yaml` only; a route committed in the base
  `user_profile.yaml` is reviewed baseline and intentionally kept).
- Built-in default/advanced tiers are fixed seeds; ArkScope does not silently
  auto-select "latest" at runtime.
- **AI Research runtime limits (shipped 2026-06-22).** `max_tool_calls`,
  subscription session timeout, and per-tool timeout now resolve **real env >
  profile DB (`research_runtime_config` table) > `user_profile(.local).yaml` >
  built-in default**. Settings → Models exposes them as "AI 研究執行限制". Today,
  `max_tool_calls` applies to both API-key and subscription Research paths;
  session/per-tool timeout apply to the subscription drivers. Server-owned runs
  remain the plan for navigation-safe/background execution and parallel Research.

Next gate:

- Retirement gate (§3) for the route keys: schema ✅, Settings UI ✅, DB-first read with
  explicit source label ✅, import ✅, export ✅, tests ✅, rollback (yaml fallback retained)
  ✅. The legacy `user_profile.local.yaml` route keys may now be relabeled fallback-only.
- Next authority target is **data-source keys/schedules** (§6.8), once the LLM/route
  authority is considered stable.

### Scoring / Per-Purpose Credentials

**Target:** purpose-specific credential bindings.

Current status (superseded 2026-08-10):

- The legacy scorer lineage is retired and `config/scoring_keys.txt` has been
  deleted. There is no file-backed scoring credential owner in the current
  product.
- A future scoring or research product must bind named DB-managed credentials
  under its own reviewed contract. It must not recreate the retired bridge.

Next gate:

- Add purpose binding only when a concrete product needs it:
  `research`, `scoring`, `summary`, `filtering`, `data_extraction`, etc. The same
  credential may be bound to multiple purposes.

### Data-Source Keys and Schedules

**Target:** Settings/token-store authoritative for user-managed data-source keys,
source enablement, and schedules.

Current status:

- Many provider keys still live in `.env`.
- Some schedules and enablement flags are still file/config driven.
- This is acceptable until the LLM credential path proves the DB-first pattern.

Next gate:

- Run a data-source config audit after the LLM config authority work stabilizes.
- Move keys and schedules incrementally, source by source, with the same
  retirement gate.

### Local Storage Authority

**Target:** every runtime storage selection resolves to a named local capability.

Current status:

- SA capture and the other runtime stores use explicit SQLite owners.

Next gate:

- Use this doc's authority rules for config flags. Storage topology remains
  governed by `LOCAL_STORAGE_TOPOLOGY.md`.

## 5. What Must Stay File/Env-Backed

Some settings should not be forced into DB:

- Path to the profile DB or workspace-local state root.
- Dev server ports and local development overrides.
- CI-only overrides.
- Emergency kill switches that must work even if DB open/migration fails.
- Checked-in static catalogs where PR review is the real control mechanism.
- One-shot apply gates for dangerous migrations, such as temporary environment
  variables that must not persist.

These are not technical debt. They are bootstrap and rescue controls.

## 6. Sequencing

> **Status reconciliation (2026-06-22):** Steps 1–4 are DONE — B1 drift fixed, B2
> model-route UI shipped, Slice 6 live verification ✅ (2026-06-19), and Claude
> `claude_code_oauth` subscription Research is **live-validated** (Slice 7B). The
> OpenAI `chatgpt_oauth`: login/token/probe/discovery are built, and S3 Research
> execution is code-wired through the raw ChatGPT-backend driver (offline-verified,
> live smoke pending). Direct OpenAI SDK-client paths still fail closed.
>
> **Model-route DB authority: SHIPPED 2026-06-22** (not a fresh framework audit —
> §2/§3/§5 already specify the framework). The per-task routes now resolve real env >
> DB > yaml > default with a full Settings authority loop (source badge, reset, yaml↔DB
> import/export), and AI Research runtime limits now resolve real env > DB > yaml >
> default — see §4 Model Routing. **Next:** server-owned Research runs for
> navigation-safe/background execution, then data-source keys/schedules (§6.8).

1. **Fix B1 drift**: update stale tests and persist resolved model on stream
   error turns.
2. **B2 model-route UI**: expose `AI 研究` in Settings and show the active route
   in Research.
3. **Slice 6 live verification**: confirm DB-selected OpenAI key affects live
   Research and Anthropic fallback is explicit.
4. **Slice 7 Claude OAuth Research driver**: make `claude_code_oauth` an actual
   Research runtime, not only a Settings/probe row.
5. **AI Research run lifecycle**: follow `AI_RESEARCH_RUN_LIFECYCLE_PLAN.md` so
   Settings owns the default AI Research route while the Research surface can
   make explicit per-run model/effort overrides.
6. **LLM config authority audit**: list every remaining LLM/model/profile/env
   setting and classify it by §2.
7. **LLM file-retirement pass**: retire or relabel legacy `.env`/YAML fields only
   after §3 gates pass.
8. **Data-source config audit**: repeat the same process for provider keys,
   schedules, source enablement, and alert settings.

## 7. Rules for Future Features

New features should declare their config authority at design time:

- Is this a user-facing setting? If yes, design the Settings/DB path from day one.
- Is this a secret? If yes, avoid plaintext export unless explicitly chosen.
- Is this a reviewed static catalog? If yes, a file may be the correct authority.
- Is this an emergency or bootstrap flag? If yes, file/env can remain primary.
- Does runtime fallback exist? If yes, the UI/logs must say it is fallback, not
  silently pretend DB is active.

The goal is not fewer files. The goal is **one honest authority per behavior**.
