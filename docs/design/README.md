# Design Docs — Index & Status Map

This index distinguishes current authority, shipped-feature references,
decision records, deferred designs, and process journals so filenames are not
mistaken for status.

**Maintenance rule:** when you add, retire, or repurpose a design doc, update
its row here in the same commit. Git history is the recovery record.

### Status legend
| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **CANON** | Current authority. Read first. Wins conflicts (hierarchy below). |
| **ACTIVE** | Current plan/build in flight. |
| **SHIPPED** | Feature delivered; spec kept as reference (may need a status-line refresh). |
| **REFERENCE** | Durable knowledge worth keeping (data quirks, patterns, education). |
| **DECISION** | Decision record — *why* we chose X. Durable. |
| **DEFERRED** | v2 / forward design; explicitly not v1 scope. |
| **PAUSED** | Preserved behind a resume gate; not active. |
| **MERGE** | Process journal — fold the load-bearing bits into canon/history; not a standalone authority. |

### Authority hierarchy (on conflict)
1. **`LOCAL_FIRST_RESEARCH_WORKBENCH_SPEC.md`** — architecture / storage / sync / migration.
2. **`ARKSCOPE_WORKBENCH_PRODUCT_SPEC.md`** — product identity / AI-output contract / permissions.
3. **`CONFIG_AUTHORITY_PLAN.md`** — config source-of-truth rules, file/env retirement gates.
4. **`ARKSCOPE_PROVIDER_CATALOG.md`** — per-provider facts. · **`ARKSCOPE_TOOL_CATALOG.md`** — tool facts.
5. Everything else defers to the above.

| `SA_EXTENSION_ROADMAP.md` | **SA Extension Roadmap** | ACTIVE | Incremental roadmap for SA extension data coverage. |

## SHIPPED — feature delivered, spec kept as reference
> These `P*`/feature names are the ones you couldn't read from the filename. They are **landed features**, kept as the reference for what was built. Refresh any "no code yet" header lines when touched.

## DECISION records

*Doc-management note (2026-06-07): the audit verdict for the 75-doc tree was 35 keep / 22 update / 7 merge / 11 discard. The 11 discards (already-archived RL/training/study docs + the executed rename runbook) were removed; the rest are kept. The recurring pain was **unreadable names/status, not uselessness** — this index is the fix. "UPDATE"-verdict docs are kept but have pre-pivot framing to refresh when next touched.*
