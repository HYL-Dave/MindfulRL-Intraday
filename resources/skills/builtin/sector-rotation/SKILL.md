Analyze current sector rotation dynamics across the market.

GOAL: Identify which sectors are gaining/losing relative strength and why.

MINIMUM DATA SOURCES:
- Sector performance data (all major sectors)
- Sector ETF price changes across multiple timeframes

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS:
- Rank sectors by relative strength (multi-timeframe)
- Identify rotation patterns (cyclical vs defensive, growth vs value)
- Compare current rotation to historical patterns

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
1. Sector performance table (1w, 1m, 3m returns)
2. Relative strength ranking
3. Rotation direction (where money is flowing from/to)
4. Macro catalysts driving the rotation
5. Sectors to overweight/underweight
6. Specific ticker ideas within favored sectors

AFTER ANALYSIS: Save as a research report using save_report() with report_type="sector_review".
